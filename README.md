## RISC-V Steel

RISC-V Steel is a free and open platform for embedded systems development based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture. It is intended for use on FPGA development boards but it can also be the start point for a new system-on-a-chip design. It features a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, programmable memory, UART transceiver and an API for software development.

### How to get started

The easiest way to get started with RISC-V Steel is to implement its [Hello World](https://github.com/riscv-steel/riscv-steel/tree/main/hello-world) project on your FPGA development board and expand it to meet your project requirements. We provide a guide with the steps to implement it on three Digilent boards: Arty A7-35T, Arty A7-100T, and Cmod-A7.
