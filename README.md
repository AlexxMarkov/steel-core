## Welcome!

**RISC-V Steel** is a free and open collection of RISC-V IP. It features a 32-bit RISC-V processor core, a configurable system-on-chip design and a suite of software and hardware tools aimed to speed up building RISC-V embedded applications.

## Available Hardware IP

 [**RISC-V Steel SoC**](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/soc-reference/)

Configurable system-on-chip design featuring RISC-V Steel Core, a RAM memory and a UART module.

[**RISC-V Steel Core**](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/core-reference/)

Area-optimized 32-bit processor design. Implements the RV32I ISA, the Zicsr extension and the Machine-mode privileged architecture of RISC-V.

## Get Started!

The [Getting Started Guide](https://riscv-steel.github.io/riscv-steel/getting-started/) shows you how to synthesize the [Hello World](https://github.com/riscv-steel/riscv-steel/tree/main/hello-world) demo for some popular FPGA boards. The demo is an instance of RISC-V Steel SoC that sends a Hello World message to a host computer via UART protocol, and its goal is to introduce you to our SoC design so that you can expand it and run your own software.
