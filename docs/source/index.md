## Introduction

RISC-V Steel is a free collection of RISC-V IP cores aimed to speed up building RISC-V systems. 

RISC-V Steel IP cores are available as Verilog files and can be either synthesized on FPGAs or manufactured as custom integrated circuits.

## Available IP cores

#### RISC-V 32-bit Processor

Area-optimized 32-bit processor. Implements the RV32I instruction set of RISC-V, the Zicsr extension and the Machine-mode privileged architecture.

#### RISC-V Steel SoC
  
All configurable system-on-chip design featuring RISC-V Steel 32-bit Processor + Tightly Coupled Memory + UART.
